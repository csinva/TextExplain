# follow-up experiments

Probably later want to switch to "bert-base-uncased", ""distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english" + try different layers + train custom dnn for this task.

- could include positional information...

- GAM version of this - train a different net for single-word embedding, multi-word, etc....
